# Project Name
> Advance regression - Problem Statement - Part I and II

## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.


## Conclusions
- The below mentioned variables are significant in predicting the price

- LotArea------------- Lot size in square feet
- OverallQual--------Rates the overall material and finish of the house
- OverallCond-------Rates the overall condition of the house
- YearBuilt-------- ---Original construction date
- BsmtFinSF1-------Type 1 finished square feet
- TotalBsmtSF------Total square feet of basement area
- GrLivArea----------Above grade (ground) living area square feet
- TotRmsAbvGrd---Total rooms above grade (does not include bathrooms)
- Street_Pave-------Pave road access to property
- RoofMatl_Metal--Roof material_Metal
- Ridge Regression  Lasso Regression
